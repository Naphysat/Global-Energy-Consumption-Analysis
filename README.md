This project analyzes global energy consumption and production for different countries

INSIGHTS

•	This project analyzes global energy production and consumption for each country. From the viz, we can see North America, United States, China, Brazil topping the chart for the global energy consumed. This can be attributed to the high population of these countries and how industrious they are.

•	Also, we can deduce from the analysis that Fossil is the highest energy consumed which is a form of non-renewable energy sources. It is known that burning of fuel causes release of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the hair. Greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere, causing global warming.


•	From the analysis, we can also see oil and coal are highly consumed. These are also non-renewable sources and are harmful to people and the environment.

•	The least energy consumed is SOLAR energy. Solar energy is a renewable source of energy and are known to have good effect on the environment.

RECOMMENDATION

•	Although, the world is becoming aware of renewable energy sources (Solar etc), we should try and intensify our efforts by sensitizing people about the positive impact of these energy in our climate. 

•	Solar and wind energy do not emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. This in turn can help save our world from climate change problem
